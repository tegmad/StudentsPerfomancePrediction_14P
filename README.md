# Students Performance Prediction

## Introduction

This project is a machine learning-based academic performance prediction system for educational institutions. It aims to analyze demographic and social factors affecting 
student outcomes and to build models that can predict performance metrics.

## Problem Statement

Educational institutions often struggle to identify students at risk of underperformance before it’s too late. Traditional evaluation methods are reactive rather than proactive. This project addresses the need for a data-driven approach to identify patterns and predict students’ academic success based on socio-economic and behavioral features.

## Objectives

- To explore how various socio-demographic attributes influence student performance
- To develop predictive models using machine learning
- To evaluate and compare model accuracy
- To visualize key patterns and correlations within the dataset

## Technology Stack

**Languages & Tools:**
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries:**
- pandas
- numpy
